# ✅ Database Events Integration Complete!

Your Event Participation Management System now displays events directly from the database instead of static data.

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Updated Flask Routes**
- **`/events`** - Now fetches all events from database and passes to template
- **`/upcoming_events`** - Shows only future events from database
- **`/registered_events`** - Displays user's registered events from database

### 2. **Enhanced Templates**
- **`events.html`** - Dynamic event cards with database data
- **`upcoming_events.html`** - Upcoming events from database
- **`registered_events.html`** - User's registered events

### 3. **Rich Event Display**
Each event card now shows:
- ✅ Event name and date
- ✅ Event description
- ✅ Location with 📍 icon
- ✅ Available spots with 🎫 icon
- ✅ Registration deadline with ⏰ icon
- ✅ Role-based action buttons

### 4. **Interactive Features**
- **Registration** - Participants can register for events via API
- **View Details** - All users can view detailed event information
- **Cancel Registration** - Placeholder for future feature

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Queries
```python
# All events (ordered by date)
events = Event.query.order_by(Event.event_date.asc()).all()

# Upcoming events only
upcoming_events = Event.query.filter(Event.event_date > datetime.utcnow()).order_by(Event.event_date.asc()).all()

# User's registered events
registrations = user.registrations
events = [reg.event for reg in registrations]
```

### Template Features
- **Dynamic content** - Events loop through database results
